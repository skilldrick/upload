upload.py

Run upload.py in the directory to be uploaded. Use the -v option
for verbose output, and the -f option to only upload files
(skipping directories). Use the -c option to specify time or size
comparison.

On Windows, place the run.bat file in the directory to be uploaded.
The upload folder will need to be added to the PATH env variable.
