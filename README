upload.py (Give me a better name!)

Run upload.py in the directory to be uploaded. Use the -v option for
verbose output, and the -f option to only upload files (skipping
directories). Use the -c option to specify time or size comparison
(i.e. upload.py -c size)

On Windows, place the run.bat file in the directory to be uploaded.
The upload.py folder will need to be added to the PATH env variable.

Files in this repository (in alphabetical order):

README: This file
ftplib.patch: Unfortunately, this script makes use of the Python3.1
ftp library, which has a bug in the ascii upload section. This patch
fixes that bug.
run.bat: The Windows Batch file that means that the command-disinclined
can run the script in verbose mode without leaving the mouse for a second
testdir/: A directory of files for test-uploading
testing.py: A place to try out new things, without breaking
anything existing
upload.py: The main script
uploadsettings.py: Settings for the script
uploadtests.py: The unit tests
